# SnakeWPF
Snake game with genetic algorithm and neural networks learning to play on it's own.
It got 2 modes with 1 or 2 neural networks as brains. 
First it is important to teach first brain how to survive by choosing how many epochs and how many individuals are in simulation. 
After learning the best snake will be displayed together with his brain working in simple graph on right. 
With first brain trained there is possibility to save the brain and upload it to training session of second brain.
Second brain learns how to survive in cirtical situations that first wouldn't take care of.
